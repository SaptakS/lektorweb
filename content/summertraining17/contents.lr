# I Know What You Are Going To Do This Summer 17[¶](#i-know-what-you-are-going-to-do-this-summer-16 "Permalink to this headline")

Do you want to see your name next time you install GNU/Linux in your friend’s computer?

Online summer training from [Linux Users Group of Durgapur](http://dgplug.org). All are welcome.

Entry Free!

This is the 10th year of the training. Our goal is to bring in more upstream
contributors to various FOSS projects. Through this training we show the path
of becoming an upstream contributor. The training lasts for almost 3 months,
sessions are generally at 18:30 IST onwards. This year there will be live view
of terminals where participants will be able to see what the trainer is doing
on the computer.
